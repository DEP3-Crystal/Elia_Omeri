    <p text-align="center">My name is Elia.I am 23 years old.I  consider myself an enthusiastic, ambitious,generous and motivated person.Strong motivation and ambition drives me to do my best. I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and consistently growing myself and taking the time to continue learning.I would describe myself as a modest but hardworking  person and consistently setting goals for myself cause as being achieved they  confirm me I on the right path and kind of motivate me going on.I never give up cause I like hard things cause I’ve always wanted to be challenged.And for me its better regreting for something I’ve done than for something I didn’t.At least I learned something. </p>
